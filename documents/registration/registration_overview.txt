Registration Overview

Students register for classes through eServices. Registration windows open at different times depending on the number of completed credits. Students should register as soon as their window opens to secure preferred courses.

Preparing to Register
- Review your Degree Audit Report (DARs) to understand required courses.
- Check for registration holds in eServices and resolve them before your window opens.
- Confirm financial aid status or payment arrangements.
- Complete placement assessments if required for math or writing courses.
- Meet with your academic advisor if you need help selecting courses.

How Registration Works
- Registration is completed online through eServices.
- Students can add, drop, or modify their schedule during the registration period.
- Waitlists are available for many courses; students are notified if a seat opens.
- Visiting students and senior citizens have separate registration dates.

Choosing Classes
- Review course descriptions and prerequisites.
- Confirm that courses count toward your degree requirements.
- Pay attention to course delivery methods (online, hybrid, in-person).
- Avoid taking unnecessary courses that do not apply to your program.

Making Registration Changes
- Students may add or drop courses during the published add/drop period.
- Dropping after the deadline may result in a withdrawal (W) on the transcript.

Registration Mistakes to Avoid

- Do not ignore prerequisites; you may be removed from the course.
- Do not repeat courses unless required.
- Do not register for courses that do not apply to your degree.
- Do not assume financial aid will cover all courses without checking eligibility.

Waitlists

- Students are notified through email if a seat becomes available.
- Waitlist priority is based on the order students join the list.

Course Delivery Methods
