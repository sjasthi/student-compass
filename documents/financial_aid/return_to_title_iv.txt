Key points:

- Aid is prorated based on the percentage of the term completed
- Unearned aid must be returned to the federal government
- Students may owe a balance to the university after the calculation
- The policy applies only to federal financial aid programs

Students considering withdrawal are encouraged to consult financial aid staff.
