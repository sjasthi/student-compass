Financial Aid Disbursement Overview

Financial aid is applied to student accounts after enrollment is verified and eligibility requirements are met. Disbursement typically occurs after the start of the term.

How disbursement works:
- Aid is first applied to tuition, fees, and other university charges
- Any remaining funds are refunded to the student
- Disbursement timing varies by term
- Students must maintain eligibility and meet enrollment requirements

Refunds are issued through the university’s refund process once aid has been applied.
