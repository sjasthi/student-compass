Financial Aid or Scholarships
Students who have received an official financial aid award letter will have their tuition payment deadline extended until one week after financial aid is disbursed. Aid is disbursed after the last day to add or drop classes.

Students are responsible for submitting all required financial aid documents by published deadlines.

Tuition Waivers
Some Minnesota State employees may qualify for tuition waivers. Waivers may be internal (Metro State) or external (other institutions or organizations). Students must ensure waivers are submitted by the deadline.

If a waiver does not cover the full amount, the student must pay the remaining balance by the tuition payment deadline. Waivers may not appear on student accounts until two weeks into the semester.
