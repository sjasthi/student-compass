Academic Policies Overview

Metro State maintains academic policies to support student progress, ensure academic integrity, and provide clear expectations for coursework and degree completion. This overview summarizes key policies students commonly encounter.

Academic Standing
Academic standing is based on cumulative GPA. Students must maintain satisfactory academic progress to remain in good standing. Low GPA may result in academic warning, probation, or suspension.

Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP)
SAP applies to financial aid eligibility. Students must meet GPA requirements, complete a minimum percentage of attempted credits, and finish their degree within the maximum timeframe. Failure to meet SAP standards may affect financial aid.

Course Repeats
Students may repeat a course to improve their grade. The most recent grade is used in GPA calculations, although all attempts remain on the transcript. Some programs may limit the number of repeats allowed.

Withdrawals
Students may withdraw from a course after the add/drop period. A withdrawal results in a “W” on the transcript and may impact financial aid. Students should consult their advisor before withdrawing.

Incomplete Grades
An incomplete (“I”) may be granted when a student has completed most coursework but cannot finish due to extenuating circumstances. Students must complete remaining work by the deadline set by the instructor.

Grading Options
Courses may offer standard letter grades, pass/fail options, or competency-based grading depending on the program. Students should review grading options before registering.

Prerequisites
Many courses require prerequisites. Students must meet prerequisite requirements before enrolling or risk being removed from the course.

Attendance Expectations
Some courses require regular attendance or participation, especially in hybrid or synchronous online formats. Requirements are listed in the course syllabus.

Academic Integrity
Students are expected to uphold academic honesty. Violations such as plagiarism, cheating, or falsifying information may result in disciplinary action.

These policies help guide academic progress and ensure consistent expectations across the university.
