Graduation and Commencement Overview

Graduation
Graduation is the official confirmation that a student has completed all degree requirements. Completion is verified through the Degree Audit Report and processed by the Registrar’s Office. Degrees are posted once per term according to the academic calendar. Students graduate in the term in which they register for the Graduation Requirements Workshop and complete all coursework.

Commencement
Commencement is a ceremonial event held twice each year (spring and fall). Participation is optional and does not indicate that degree requirements are complete. Commencement events are coordinated by Student Life and Leadership Development.
